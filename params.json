  "body": "About\r\n======\r\ntheZoo is a project created to make the possibility of malware analysis open and available to the public. Since we have found out that almost all versions of malware are very hard to come by in a way which will allow analysis we have decided to gather all of them for you in an available and safe way.\r\ntheZoo was born by Yuval tisf Nativ and is now maintained by Shahak Shalev. \r\n![](http://hackingdefined.org/publications/MalDB-Logo-Thumb.png)\r\n\r\n**theZoo is open and welcoming visitors!**\r\nDisclaimer\r\n==========\r\ntheZoo's purpose is to allow the study of malware and enable people who are interested in malware analysis or maybe even as a part of their job to have access to live malware, analyse the  ways they operate and maybe even enable advanced and savvy  people to block specific malwares within their own environment.\r\n\r\n**Please remember that these are live and dangerous malware! They come encrypted and locked for a reason!  Do NOT run them unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing! They are to be used only for educational purposes (and we mean that!) !!!**\r\n\r\nWe recommend running them in a VM which has no internet connection (or an internal virtual network if you must) and without guest additions or any equivalents. Some of them are worms and will automatically try to spread out. Running them unconstrained meaning the you **will infect yourself or others with vicious and dangerous malwares!!!**\r\n\r\n\r\nGPL 3\r\n======\r\ntheZoo - the most awesome free malware database on the air \r\nCopyright (C) 2015, Yuval Nativ, Lahad Ludar, 5fingers\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It now runs both CLI and ARGVS modes. You can call the program with the same command line arguments as before.\r\nThe current default state of theZoo runtime is the CLI. The following files and directories are responsible for the application's behaviour.\r\n\r\n### /conf\r\nThe conf folder holds files relevant to the particular running of the program but are not part of the application. You can find the EULA file in the conf and more.\r\n### /imports\r\nContains .py and .pyc import files used by the rest of the application\r\n### /malwares/Binaries\r\nThe actual malwares samples - be careful!\r\n### /malware/Source\r\nMalware source code :)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Directory Structure:\r\nEach directory is composed of 4 files:\r\n- Malware files in an encrypted ZIP archive. \r\n- SHA256 sum of the 1st file. \r\n- MD5 sum of the 1st file.\r\n- Password file for the archive. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Structure of maldb.db\r\nmaldb.db is the DB which theZoo is acting upon to find malwares indexed on your drive.\r\nThe structure is as follows:\r\n\r\n\tuid,location,type,name,version,author,language,date,architecture,platform,comments,tags\r\n\r\n- UID \t-\tDetermined based on the indexing process.\r\n- Location \tThe location on the drive of the malware you have searched for.\r\n- Type\t-\tSorts the different types of malware there are. So far we sort by:\tVirus, Trojans, Botnets, Ransomeware, Spyware\r\n- Name\t-\tJust the name of the malware.\r\n- Version\t-\tNothing to say here as well.\r\n- Author\t-\t... I'm not that into documentation...\r\n- Programming Language - The state of the malware as for source, bin or which type of source. c/cpp/bin...\r\n- Date\t-\tSee 'Author' section.\r\n- Architecture -    The arch the platform was build for. Can be x86, x64, arm7....\r\n- Platform -    Win32, Win64, *nix32, *nix64, iOS, android and so on.\r\n- Comments - Any comments there may be about the item.\r\n- Tags - Tags matching the item.\r\n\r\nAn example line will look as follow:\r\n\r\n    104,Source/Original/Dexter,trojan,Dexter,2,unknown,c,00/05/2013,x86,win32,NULL,Source\r\n\r\nBugs and Reports\r\n================\r\nThe repository holding all files is currently \r\n\thttps://github.com/ytisf/theZoo\r\n\r\n## Change Log for v0.60:\r\n- [x] Moved DB to SQLite3.\r\n- [x] Searching overhaul to a freestyle fashion.\r\n- [x] Fixed \"get\" command.\r\n- [x] More & more malwares.\r\n\r\n## Change Log for v0.50:\r\n- [x] Better and easier UI. \r\n- [x] Aligned printing of malwares. \r\n- [x] Command line arguments are now working. \r\n- [x] Added 10 more malwares (cool ones) to the DB.\r\n\r\n## Change Log for v0.42:\r\n- [x] Fix EULA for proper disclaimer.\r\n- [x] More precise searching and indexing including platform and more.\r\n- [x] Added 10 new malwares.\r\n- [x] Git update of platform and new malware.\r\n- [x] Fix display of search.\r\n- [x] Enable support for platform and architecture in indexing.\r\n- [x] Separate between database and application.\r\n- [x] UI improvements.\r\n\r\n## Change Log for v0.43:\r\n- [X] Verify argv to be working properly.
